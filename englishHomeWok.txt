    In 9,1,2018, I leave from HuNan alone for study,which is the first time in my life.Everything is brand-new,and everything
is unfamiliar to me.I raise a big interest to DaLian.
    Defferent from my hometown Dalian's urban construction is a combination of China, Janpan, and Russia even Korea.So in
Dalian I can experence many culture's feeling.At afternoon,I got to the light rail where I got anthor excellant feeling
that I find it use five languages to Broadcast prompt,it is amazing.In ChangSha, subway use two language,a Child collection
of Dalian light rail.
    In that night I got the most challenge in that day which is going to the bathhouse for a shower.In HuNan that every
dormitory has its own little house for shower,But there don't have.And it is puzzled me that in fact every dormitory have
a  lavatory.So why not build a washroom in there?Later I think maybe it is wash culture.When I come to the washroom,I even
feel embarrassed that everyone is naked.Scarry me!Quickly I finish it and go to my dormitory.
    Also in that day,I have the first dinner in our school's canteen.So delicious,There many food and different to our high
school,everything is delicious.However after some days It seems that in our school there not a dishes that tastes very spicy.
In our hometown, most of the dishes will input some pepper but there not.So in that days I was sincerely missing my home.
    After one semester in Dalian,I find that i have had a better adaptability for life I can go to the washroom alone,I
don't very miss Hunan cuisine.Everything is getting better.
